# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Record Template

**Status:** Template  
**Date:** 2025-08-01  
**Authors:** Terragon Labs  
**Reviewers:** Development Team  

## Context

This template provides a standardized format for documenting architecture decisions in the Explainable-MoE-Debugger project. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) help us track the reasoning behind significant technical decisions and their consequences.

## Decision

We will use this template for all architecture decisions that:
- Affect the overall system architecture
- Introduce new technologies or frameworks
- Change existing interfaces or APIs
- Impact performance, security, or scalability
- Have long-term consequences for the project

## Template Format

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Short Title of Decision]

**Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Superseded]  
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Authors:** [Names of decision makers]  
**Reviewers:** [Names of reviewers]  

## Context

[Describe the context and problem statement that led to this decision. Include relevant background information, constraints, and requirements.]

## Considered Options

1. **Option 1**: [Brief description]
   - Pros: [List advantages]
   - Cons: [List disadvantages]

2. **Option 2**: [Brief description]  
   - Pros: [List advantages]
   - Cons: [List disadvantages]

3. **Option N**: [Brief description]
   - Pros: [List advantages]
   - Cons: [List disadvantages]

## Decision

[State the decision clearly and concisely. Explain why this option was chosen over the alternatives.]

## Consequences

### Positive
- [List positive outcomes and benefits]

### Negative  
- [List negative outcomes and trade-offs]

### Neutral
- [List neutral impacts and considerations]

## Implementation

- [List implementation steps or requirements]
- [Include timeline if relevant]
- [Identify responsible parties]

## Monitoring

- [How will we measure success?]
- [What metrics will we track?]
- [When will we review this decision?]

## References

- [Links to relevant documents, discussions, or external resources]
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- Standardized documentation of architectural decisions
- Better understanding of system evolution over time  
- Easier onboarding for new team members
- Historical context for future decisions

### Negative
- Additional overhead for documenting decisions
- Requires discipline to maintain up-to-date records

## Implementation

1. All significant architectural decisions must be documented using this template
2. ADRs should be numbered sequentially (0001, 0002, etc.)
3. ADRs must be reviewed and approved before implementation
4. ADRs should be stored in the `docs/adr/` directory
5. Each ADR should be referenced in relevant code comments and documentation
