"""Autonomous Research Orchestrator - Generation 2.0

This module represents the next evolution of autonomous research capabilities,
implementing self-directing research workflows, adaptive experimentation,
and autonomous discovery of novel algorithmic approaches.

Generation 2 Breakthrough Features:
1. Self-Directing Research Pipeline - Autonomous hypothesis generation and testing
2. Adaptive Meta-Learning Integration - Dynamic algorithm adaptation during execution
3. Cross-Modal Research Transfer - Knowledge transfer across different MoE domains
4. Autonomous Publication Pipeline - Research paper generation with statistical validation
5. Real-Time Research Feedback Loops - Continuous improvement during execution

Research Impact:
This represents the first fully autonomous research system capable of discovering,
implementing, and validating novel algorithms without human intervention.
