# Contributing to Explainable-MoE-Debugger

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Explainable-MoE-Debugger project! This guide will help you get started with contributing to our Chrome DevTools-inspired debugging platform for Mixture of Experts models.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Current Project Status
**Note**: This project is currently in the **documentation and planning phase**. We're building comprehensive architectural foundations before implementation. Your contributions to planning, design, and early prototyping are especially valuable!

### Ways to Contribute
- 📚 **Documentation**: Improve existing docs, add examples, fix typos
- 🔬 **Research**: Validate technical approaches, propose improvements
- 💡 **Design**: UI/UX suggestions, visualization concepts
- 🛠️ **Prototyping**: Build proof-of-concept implementations
- 🐛 **Testing**: Test planned features, report issues
- 🌐 **Community**: Help others, participate in discussions

## 📋 Prerequisites

### For Documentation Contributors
- Basic familiarity with Markdown
- Understanding of ML/MoE concepts (helpful but not required)

### For Future Code Contributors
- Python 3.10+ and Node.js 18+
- Experience with PyTorch, React, or FastAPI (depending on area)
- Familiarity with MoE architectures (preferred)

## 🏗️ Development Setup

### Phase 1: Documentation Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/danieleschmidt/Explainable-MoE-Debugger.git
cd Explainable-MoE-Debugger

# Create a new branch for your contribution
git checkout -b feature/your-contribution-name

# Make your changes and submit a PR
```

### Future: Full Development Environment
```bash
# Backend setup (planned)
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install

# Frontend setup (planned)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# Start development server (planned)
docker-compose up -d
```

## 📝 Contribution Guidelines

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where applicable
- Follow existing document structure and style
- Add diagrams for complex concepts (Mermaid preferred)

### Code Standards (Future)
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use TypeScript for all JavaScript code
- Write tests for new features
- Maintain test coverage above 90%
- Follow semantic commit conventions

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): brief description

- type: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- scope: area of change (frontend, backend, docs, etc.)
- description: what you changed in present tense
```

Examples:
```
docs(architecture): clarify expert routing flow diagram
feat(backend): add basic PyTorch hook integration
fix(frontend): resolve visualization performance issue
```
