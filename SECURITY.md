# Security Policy

## Overview

The Explainable-MoE-Debugger project takes security seriously. As a debugging platform for machine learning models, we handle sensitive model data, computational resources, and potentially proprietary research information. This document outlines our security practices and how to report vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

**Note**: As this project is currently in the documentation/planning phase, version 0.1.x refers to our upcoming initial release.

## Security Considerations

### Model Data Protection
- **Model Weights**: We never serialize or transmit complete model weights
- **Gradient Information**: Gradient data is sanitized to prevent model extraction
- **Activation Data**: Only aggregated statistics are collected, not raw activations
- **Token Data**: Input tokens are processed locally and can be anonymized

### Infrastructure Security
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 integration with industry-standard providers
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) for multi-user deployments
- **Encryption**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, and secure headers

### Privacy Considerations
- **Local Processing**: Debugging data can remain on user's infrastructure
- **Minimal Data**: Only essential debugging information is collected
- **User Control**: Users control what data is shared and with whom
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for security monitoring

## Threat Model

### Potential Threats
1. **Model Extraction**: Attempts to reconstruct model weights from debugging data
2. **Data Poisoning**: Malicious inputs to compromise debugging analysis
3. **Denial of Service**: Resource exhaustion attacks on debugging infrastructure
4. **Information Disclosure**: Unauthorized access to model architecture or training data
5. **Supply Chain**: Compromised dependencies or build processes

### Mitigations
1. **Differential Privacy**: Statistical noise added to prevent model extraction
2. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization of all user inputs
3. **Resource Limits**: Configurable limits on computational resources
4. **Access Controls**: Fine-grained permissions for different user roles
5. **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning of all dependencies

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Support for TOTP, WebAuthn
- **Single Sign-On**: Integration with enterprise SSO providers
- **API Key Management**: Secure API key generation and rotation
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with proper timeouts

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for stored data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- **Key Management**: Secure key storage and rotation procedures
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary debugging information

### Infrastructure Security
- **Container Security**: Minimal attack surface in Docker images
- **Network Security**: Network policies and firewall configurations
- **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of passwords and API keys
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report
**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them responsibly by:

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@explainable-moe-debugger.org` (planned)

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and affected components
- **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the issue
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation
