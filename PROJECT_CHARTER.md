# Project Charter: Explainable-MoE-Debugger

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 1, 2025  
**Project Sponsor:** Daniel Schmidt  
**Project Manager:** Terragon Labs Development Team  

## Executive Summary

The Explainable-MoE-Debugger project aims to create the first comprehensive, real-time debugging and visualization platform specifically designed for Mixture of Experts (MoE) models. This Chrome DevTools-inspired interface will enable ML researchers and engineers to understand, optimize, and troubleshoot MoE architectures with unprecedented visibility into expert routing, load balancing, and token attribution.

## Project Vision

**Vision Statement:** To democratize MoE model understanding by providing intuitive, powerful debugging tools that make complex expert routing behaviors as transparent and debuggable as traditional software systems.

**Mission:** Create an open-source platform that reduces the barrier to entry for MoE model development and optimization, enabling researchers and practitioners to build more efficient and reliable MoE systems.

## Business Case

### Problem Statement
Mixture of Experts models are becoming increasingly prevalent in large-scale ML deployments, but debugging and optimizing these systems remains challenging due to:

1. **Limited Visibility:** Traditional debugging tools don't capture expert routing decisions
2. **Complex Behaviors:** Expert selection patterns are difficult to understand and optimize
3. **Performance Issues:** Dead experts, load imbalances, and routing inefficiencies are hard to detect
4. **Development Friction:** Lack of specialized tools slows MoE development cycles
5. **Knowledge Gap:** Limited tooling makes MoE development accessible only to experts

### Business Objectives
1. **Accelerate MoE Development:** Reduce debugging time by 50%
2. **Improve Model Performance:** Enable 20% better expert utilization
3. **Lower Barrier to Entry:** Make MoE development accessible to broader ML community
4. **Establish Standards:** Define best practices for MoE debugging and optimization
5. **Build Ecosystem:** Create foundation for MoE tooling ecosystem

### Success Criteria
- **Adoption:** 1,000+ active users within 12 months
